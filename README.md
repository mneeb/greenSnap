# What is greenSnap?

greenSnap is an app created by me and my Computer Science Team!


# Special Thanks to _The Hartford_ and _Capgemini_

Initially, greenSnap was created with the help of the mentors at The Hartford and Capgemini.

Our school had a field-trip oppurtunity by Junior Achievement where we would travel to The Hartford building an inssurance company in my local-area.

This oppurtunity was similar to the show _Shark Tank_ where contestants would compete with different teams to create a final-product, This field-trip was very similiar we would compete with different schools and groups to create a product where we would show to a group of judges in _The Hartford_ and _Capgemini_.

# What was our idea?


Our idea was simple create an app that tackles climate change, We came up with the idea of greenSnap an App similar to the popular game PokeMon GO.

User's would take photos of their local-area where an algorithm can detect if there is trash on the ground or in the area.

If User's take a video of them cleaning up their local-area they would recieve in game-currency also known as _BioPoints_

The algorithm would take a few-days to proccess the video where then the user would recieve their points which then can be redeemed for Gift-Cards and Currency wheater it be USD OR Euro.



# Creating the App

While our Computer-Science class did not have App-Development courses we still wanted to tackle this.

The reason we choose to create an App is because me and my team were intrested in Swift and Kotlin, So we started creating the mockup of the app. At first it was pretty challenging since we only had a few-weeks to complete the App and Present it to the judges, We were also competing against groups of people. 



# Conclusion

Once the app was complete we decided to showcase the mockup in a booth, We talked about the app and the overall purpose of it.


The day came where we had to present to the judges, Quitefrankly me and my-team where nearvous to showcase greenSnap, The presentation went well the room full of company executives was quite overwhelming to say the least.


However, at the end we lost a huge-blow we spent weeks creating the app, But this was also a good thing I found a passion for App-Development in general.
